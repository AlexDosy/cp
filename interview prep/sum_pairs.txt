we store in a frequency map(hash map). with num counts
we loop through and get all the elements complement and check through the freq map


  let count: Record<number, number>={}
  let operation=0
  for (const num of nums){
    const  comp=k-num
    if(count[comp] && count[comp]>0){
        operation++
        count[comp]--

    }
    else{
        count[num]=(count[num]||0) +1
    }

  }
  return opration
