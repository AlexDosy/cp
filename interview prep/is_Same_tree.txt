class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if not p and not q:
            return True
        
        if p and q and p.val == q.val:
            return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        
        return False


if both p and q are non-empty and have the same root value, we recursively call the isSameTree function on their left and right subtrees. This recursive call checks if the left subtrees of p and q are the same and if the right subtrees of p and q are the same. If all these conditions are met, it returns True, indicating that the trees are the same.
