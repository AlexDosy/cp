Idea
Rotating a list to the right by k means:
The last k nodes move to the front
The relative order stays the same
Key observations
If the list is empty, has one node, or k = 0 → return as is
Rotating by k is the same as rotating by k % length
If you temporarily make the list circular, the problem becomes easy
