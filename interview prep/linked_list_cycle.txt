def hasCycle(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if slow == fast:

    return False


Use slow pointer → moves 1 step

Use fast pointer → moves 2 steps

If there is a cycle, fast and slow will eventually meet

If fast reaches null, there is no cycle
