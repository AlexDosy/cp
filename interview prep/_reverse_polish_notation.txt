Traverse the tokens from left to right.

If the token is a number → push it onto the stack.

If the token is an operator:

Pop the second operand (b)

Pop the first operand (a)

Compute a operator b

Push the result back onto the stack

At the end, the stack contains exactly one value, which is the result.

⚠️ Division must truncate toward zero, which is important for negative numbers.
