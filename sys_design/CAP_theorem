CP: Consistency + Partition Tolerance

    Behavior: If the system detects a network partition (communication break), it shuts down non-consistent nodes or blocks writes to ensure no data divergence occurs.

AP: Availability + Partition Tolerance
    Behavior: If a partition occurs, the system keeps accepting reads and writes on all nodes, even if they cannot 
    talk to each other. This leads to "Eventual Consistency" (the nodes will sync up later when the network is fixed).
